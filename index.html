                <p>I am a <span>Web Development student at Skillcrush</span> who loves learning about code and how it works. I see code like a puzzle just waiting to be solved! I enjoy interacting with the wonderful and helpful community of students that Skillcrush has built up and nurtured.</p>

                <p>I was brought up in California, on a small farm in the city of Clovis, where I learned many lifeskills that many don't get the opportunity to experience. I spent most of my childhood learning to till orchards with a tractor, how to properly grow and manage a garden and orchards, and how to build/mend/maintain many things on the property. I'm thankful for the lessons I learned in my younger years, as many of them come in handy in my adulthood!</p>
            </div>
            <div id="div-2" class="flex-items">
                <p>There are many hobbies that I've dabbled in through the years, but my passions are baking and getting my hands dirty creating any form of art. There's nothing better than decorating a cake or painting a fond memory on canvas, singing along to my favorite music that's playing in the background!</p>
            </div>
            <div id="div-3" class="flex-items">
                <p>A fact about myself: I have genetic disorder called Ehlers Danlos, also known as EDS. It's a connective tissue disorder that affects the production of collagen in my body. As a result, my joints are very prone to dislocations and my body can get a bit finicky at times. I've learned over the years that I can't let my EDS hold me back from doing the things I love, but I also have to remember to listen to my body and rest when I need to. I'm not going to let it get me down!</p>
